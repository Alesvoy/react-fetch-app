# Alejandro Butron Front End challenge for Fetch

For this challenge I decided to use React + TypeScript. I wanted to keep the level bleeding edge technologies low in order to showcase my abilities and use small libraries that are often used in modern React applications.

## What you need to run this app locally

Make sure you open this app on Chrome but on the Desktop version, since this app does not run on mobile web browsers or other browsers that are not directly Chrome on desktop.
